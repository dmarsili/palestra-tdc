# Contributing Guide

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these basics:

- Use branches like `type/short-description` (e.g., `docs/add-contributing`).
- Use Conventional Commits for messages: `type(scope): short summary`.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Add or update docs when behavior changes.

## Conventional Commit Types
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: docs only changes
- chore: tooling, config, cleanup
- refactor: non-behavior code change
- test: add or update tests

## Development
- Node 20+
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Start dev: `npm run dev`

Thanks! ðŸ™Œ
